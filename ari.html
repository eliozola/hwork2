                <p>Tea Ceremony has an ability to bring peace into our lives by taking us from our heads, from our
                    thoughts
                    to the heart, to the body. And how does it do it?
                    By engaging all our senses at the same time and really savouring each moment. Can we taste, smell,
                    see,
                    hear, feel - all at the same time? When we do, then another sense is created - a sense of the Heart.
                    When we are able to do do that, then we are able to have a direct experience of Life, direct
                    experience
                    of being - rather than through filters of the mind such as concepts, ideas, beliefs. </p>

                <p>Meditation ( and Tea Ceremony) is actually a form of listening. With all our senses. With our whole
                    body.
                    Because this body is a sensing instrument through which we contact this reality - experience of
                    being
                    and living, wellbeing, this whole thing, this wonderful amazing organic structure through which we
                    function.
                    This extraordinary, potentially sensitive, listening, feeling organism.
                    So I encourage you to use it. Use it to listen really deeply. To that, which is trying to emerge
                    within
                    you. Because that, which is trying to emerge within us, responds in the same way as you and I do
                    when we
                    are listened to.
                    It does respond. It doesn't respond in a way that you can necessarily predict or control. But it
                    does
                    respond.</p>
