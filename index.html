                <p>Tea Ceremony has an ability to bring peace into our lives by taking us from our heads, from our thoughts to the heart, to the body. And how does it do it? 
                    By engaging all our senses at the same time and really savouring each moment. Can we taste, smell, see, hear, feel - all at the same time? When we do, then another sense is created - a sense of the Heart.
                    When we are able to do do that, then we are able to have a direct experience of Life, direct experience of being - rather than through filters of the mind such as concepts, ideas, beliefs.</p>

                        Meditation ( and Tea Ceremony) is actually a form of listening. With all our senses. With our whole body. Because this body is a sensing instrument through which we contact this reality - experience of being and living, wellbeing, this whole thing, this wonderful amazing organic structure through which we function. 
                          This extraordinary, potentially sensitive, listening, feeling organism.
                        So I encourage you to use it. Use it to listen really deeply. To that, which is trying to emerge within you. Because that, which is trying to emerge within us, responds in the same way as you and I do when we are listened to. 
                        It does respond. It doesn't respond in a way that you can necessarily predict or control. But it does respond.

                    All the ceremonies and rituals - they are just ways of reminding us to exercise awareness. To show up. To show up in a real, honest and authentic way. That's what they are there for. If we don't get that, they will seem like mere rituals. 
                              Just doing something because we are supposed to do it. But then when we start getting what it is really about - it's about many, many, many moments in any given day - a way of PAUSE, CHECK IN, are you SHOWING UP, are you actually here or are you lost in some internal narrative that is commenting on what is being here. 
                              Where are you? What are you doing? How honestly you have shown up in this moment in your life? That's what these little moments of rituals are trying to evoke in us. They are expressions of that.</p>
